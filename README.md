01 Abstract

When you cut a tree and sell the wood, you will earn money. When you plant a tree, you are
creating value, but you won’t get paid. Ecological value is not well articulated in our economy.
The ECO coin aims to fix this. It is a new cryptocurrency that positively rewards people with
ECOs for their sustainable actions. It is also the first cryptocurrency to be backed by sustainable
assets; every ECO coin is backed by one tree. As more ecological assets are added to the system,
more ECO coins become available. This also makes the ECO coin a living currency. Just as our
ecology cycles through growth and decay, so too do ECO coins. ECOs coins are born, live and
decay over time. The currency is governed by a Decentralised Autonomous Charity (DAC) so
that not one organisation, but all those who use it have a voice in its development. Sustainable
actions are verified by the crowd, through smart IOT integration and by certified vendors. 

02 Motivation

For decades, economists have argued that
prosperity requires growth, with environmental
damage as the regrettable but unavoidable
consequence. Our environment is often seen
as an external cost, or a business externality.
A negative externality is the creation of
air pollution through burning fossil fuels.
A positive externality on the other hand
is carbon sequestration by trees. These
externalities are not well articulated in our
current economic outlook. We do not see the
enormous value that is all around us. Efforts to
include our ecology into our economy often
fall short.
For example, Ecosystem Services1
 is a
framework built upon the idea of “natural
capital” whereby every service provided by
our environment is given an economic value
in euros and cents. However there has been
strong resistance to this commodification and
price tagging of nature. How do you work
out the value of an inspiring walk through the
forest or the sound of birds tweeting? We
know that nature is valuable but should we be
giving it an economic value in such a direct
way? What are the consequences of such an
idea? There is a danger that the price of the
ecosystem will be superseded and so replaced:
the lake is worth €10 million, but if we replace
the lake with a road that has a value of €11
million then goodbye lake, fish, insects,
biodiversity and biosphere.
Emissions trading2, another idea to protect
the environment, is a way to cap and trade
pollution with the goal to reduce the amount
of emissions in the coming year. The idea
has good intentions but at best can be
bureaucratic and slow to enforce and at worst
simply moves the problem elsewhere. Both
these solutions are top down and designed in
a way to limit damage. They are constructed
to negatively reinforce people to do less bad.
But what if we flipped that idea on its head
and instead positively incentivised people
to do more good? If you can make money
from cutting down a tree why can’t you make
money planting one?
There are many ways in which we can
incentivise behaviour, probably the most
powerful and ubiquitous is money. Our fiat
currencies, such as pounds, euros and dollars,
incentivise billions of people around the world
every day. It seems then only logical that we
should design a new currency to both value
and reward ecological action. We call it the
ECO coin. 

03 The ECO coin

What is the ECO coin?
The ECO coin is a new cryptocurrency that is earned through sustainable action. The ECO coin
aims to reward anyone, anywhere in the world carrying out sustainable actions. Eating meat-free
meals, switching to a green energy provider or riding a bike to work can earn you ECOs which
you can spend in our new sustainable marketplace to buy ecological experiences, services and
goods.
ECO coins are stored in special digital wallets accessible through a web browser at first then
through a mobile app. A digital wallet can do much more than a physical wallet as it can receive
ECOs, store them and send them to other digital wallets. Wallets can also display information
about what sustainable actions can be carried out and where the currency can be spent.
What sustainable actions can I earn ECO coins with?
There will be a variety of sustainable actions that people can recieve ECO coins for carrying out.
As time goes on, the community, that is those who use the currency, can add more actions to the
system to expand the pool of sustainable actions possible. Of course not all sustainable actions
require the same amount of time, energy or have the same impact. This means that different
actions will have different amounts of ECO coins available. See table 

Example Sustainable Actions

< table >

Over time as sustainable actions become the
“new normal” the amount of ECOs received
for the actions will go down. Dynamic pricing
will also be used so that prices can vary from
one location to another. For example, in the
Netherlands it’s very normal to bike to work.
However in Portugal bikes are used much
less often3. So someone biking in Portugal
earns more ECOs than someone biking in the
Netherlands.
How are sustainable actions verified?
It’s extremely important that actions are
verified, otherwise it is becomes too easy for
bad actors to game the system. There are
currently three ways in which sustainable
verification can take place:
1. Sensor Integration - Here we look to use
the sensors that are already around us. As
we move closer to a world in which we are
surrounded by smart sensors that can record
our daily activities, we can tap into this and
use it to verify sustainable actions. Take the
example of a smart thermostat. It can record
exactly when the thermostat is adjusted
during the day and can even know who is in
the room at the time. With this information,
people in the room can automatically receive
ECOS when the temperature is lowered
a few degrees below average for that
neighbourhood. The ECO coin can integrate
many smart systems through API protocols
so that we can capture actions relating to
transportation, energy usage and waste flow
to name a few.
2. ECO Inspectors - The role of a
cryptocurrency miner is to verify transactions
and so secure the network using specialised,
energy intensive machines4. For their service
in verifying transactions, miners are rewarded
in the cryptocurrency. In the ECO coin system,
we see a new role: the ECO inspector who
verifies that sustainable actions are carried
out. For this work, they are rewarded with a
small amount of ECO coins per verification. For
example, think of a security guard monitoring
a place of work. They can see what goes on
and can supplement their income by becoming
an ECO inspector, making sure people arrive
to the office by bike, grab a meat free lunch or
recycle their paper.
